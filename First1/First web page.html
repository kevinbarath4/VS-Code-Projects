                Gee, this stuff looks like a lot but I guess when you really put your mind to something and are really passionate about it, it can be very rewarding because you always wanted to achieve that goal in the first place!

                This looks absolutely absurd, But rest assured I am a normal human being (kinda). This was me at a value village in Sportsworld Kitchener, ON and I must say this was quite fun to make! The only issue is how do I make the damn thing SMALLER!
